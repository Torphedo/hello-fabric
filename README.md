This mod only supports Fabric 1.16.x. More versions may be supported later in the future.

## Setup
Simply download the mod and put it in your mods folder (It should be in your game directory).  
This will **not** work on Forge.  
You need Mod Menu if you want to change the message.

## What does this do?
It sends a customizable message when you join a server.
