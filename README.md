# Hello!

> This mod is unmaintained, ~~as I like to procrastinate~~.

This mod only supports Fabric 1.16.x and 1.18.x. More versions may be supported later in the future.
Building is currently broken. Will fix later.

## Setup
Simply download the mod and put it in your mods folder (It should be in your game directory).  
This will **not** work on Forge.  
~~You need Mod Menu if you want to change the message.~~
Mod Menu integrations are currently broken.

## What does this do?
It sends a customizable message when you join a server.

## Dependencies
This mod depends on Fabric API and Cloth Config.
[Download a version of Cloth Config for your Minecraft version here.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/)
